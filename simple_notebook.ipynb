    "### Basic Implementation\n",
    "Let's start with a very simple implementation to demonstrate how you can generate an output file with some simple instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create an ```agenda``` object to organize and store our instructions, then use that to run our ```SimpleCoder``` agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each ```SimpleCoder``` instance takes one instruction item to run, and outputs one file. We will handle complex agendas, messaging, etc somewhere else. This will allow us to simplify our code and focus on refining the core functionality, which features recursive calling that will be much easier to understand and troubleshoot without the additional overhead."

    "- The agent iterates until it determines that the code meets the specified requirements, and then issue a stop signal.
